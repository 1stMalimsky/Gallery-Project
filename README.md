<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="./public/assets/imgs/screenshot1.png">

Welcome to my photo gallery. You're welcome to browse the photos within or upload you own
photos. I've set up three display options:

- List display
- Gallery display
- Carousel (sideshow) display

Only signed up, business account users can add, edit and delete photos.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get started, I recommend signing up. That way you'll get all the functions out of the website. Here's where you sign up:
<br>
<br>
<img src="./public/assets/imgs/signupScreenshot.png">
<br>
<br>
As a new user, you must input your full name, a valid email address and a password.<br> There is extra info you can add about yourself and you're welcome to do so after signing up as well in the 'profile' tab.<br><br>

To navigate between display options, simply click one of the display icons under the display options title:
<br>
<img src="./public/assets/imgs/DisplayOptionsScreenshot.png" >
<br>
<br>
To edit, remove and buy(not working at the moment), choose the list display and choose the photo you'd like to change (marked in green). To add a new photo, click the 'add new photo' button on the navbar (marked in red):
<br>

<br>

### Prerequisites

Before you can use or contribute to this project, you will need to have the following software and tools installed:
<br>

Git: You can download and install Git from the official website at git-scm.com.
Code editor: You will need a code editor to modify and work with the project files.
<br>
I recommend using Visual Studio Code, which you can download from code.visualstudio.com.
<br>
Web browser: To view the website, you will need a web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

### Installation

To use this project, you can either download the source code or clone the repository using Git. To clone the repository, follow these steps:

    Open a terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project files.
    Run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/1stMalimsky/Gallery-Project.git

Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to the project directory:

    cd your-repository

    Open the project files in your preferred code editor and start making changes!

Alternatively, you can download the source code as a ZIP file by clicking on the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page and selecting "Download ZIP". Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired location and open the project files in your preferred code editor.

Note that this project does not require any additional dependencies or packages to run.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

    Clone or download the project files as described in the "Installation" section.
    Open the project files in your preferred code editor.
    Make any necessary changes or modifications to the project files.
    Save your changes.
    Commit your changes and push them to the remote repository on GitHub.

If you want to view the website locally, you can use a local development server to serve the files. One way to do this is by using a code editor with a built-in server, such as Visual Studio Code. To start a local server using Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

    Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the project directory.
    Click on the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner of the editor.
    Your default web browser should open and display the website.

Note that this project is also hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed by visiting the URL provided in the "GitHub Pages" section of the repository's settings page.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

Here are some planned improvements and bug fixes for this project:
<br>
<br>

1. Fix the "Buy Now" option: Currently, the "Buy Now" button is not functioning yet. We plan to fix this issue in the next release.<br><br>
2. Improve the Carousel display: The current carousel display could use some improvements to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. We plan to make some changes tothe carousel display in the next release.<br><br>
3. Add transition animation features: To enhance the user experience, we plan to add transition animations to the website in the next release. These animations will help make the website more engaging and visually appealing.<br><br>
4. Create an actual Cart page: Currently, there is no dedicated cart page on the website. We plan to create a dedicated cart page that will allow users to view their selected items and proceed to checkout. This will improve the overall shopping experience onthe website.
   <br>
   <br>
   We are committed to improving this project and will continue to add new features and functionality in future releases. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
